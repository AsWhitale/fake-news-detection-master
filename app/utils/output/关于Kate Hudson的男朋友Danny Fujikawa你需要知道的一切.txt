After 15 years of friendship,
Kate Hudson
and
Danny Fujikawa
realized that their relationship was something more.
The couple made their public debut in May 2017 and welcomed their first child together, daughter
Rani Rose
, a year later.
"I've seen her do things that I can't imagine doing myself and I'm very proud of her," Fujikawa
said of Hudson
shortly after Rani's birth. "And I'm in awe of her for some of the things that she is able to do when she sets her mind to it."

In September 2021, Fujikawa
proposed to Hudson
after nearly five years of dating.
So who is Hudson's fianc√©? Here is everything to know about Danny Fujikawa.
He worked in the music industry

Fujikawa was the singer and guitarist for Los Angeles-based band
Chief
. The band released the EP "The Castle Is Gone" in 2009 and their debut full-length album, "Modern Rituals," in 2010 before they parted ways in June 2011.
In 2013, he founded Lightwave Records with The Delta Mirror frontman Chris Acosta. The company's
Facebook page
states that the duo founded Lightwave as "a way to release their music on their own terms."
He studied music at New York University

According to his
LinkedIn
, Fujikawa studied recorded music at NYU between 2004 and 2006 but "left early to travel the world" and play music. He formed Chief while in college with his brother, Michael Fujikawa, and bandmates Evan Koga and Mike Moonves, son of former CBS exec
Les Moonves
.
"Chief has opened my eyes musically," Fujikawa told
Domino Publishing Company
. "I'm not just working on my own anymore and in that way I've grown as a person: I started out as a guitarist and now I have a voice."
He is related to the Foster family by marriage
Kate Hudson and Danny Fujikawa.

Fujikawa's late father, Ron, was in a 10-year-relationship with
Rebecca Dyer
at the time of his death in 2012. Dyer has three daughters with famed musician
David Foster
:
Jordan
,
Erin
and
Sara Foster
.
Though Ron and Rebecca never married, the Foster sisters
consider Fujikawa their stepbrother
. Additionally, Fujikawa has two biological brothers, Michael and Braden.
He first met Hudson over a decade ago

In a December 2017
Instagram
post, the
Bride Wars
star shared the story of how she first met her husband-to-be. At the time, Hudson was 23 and
pregnant
with her eldest child,
Ryder Russell Robinson
. The pair met through the actress' best friends, Sara and Erin, who are also Fujikawa's stepsisters.
"And so it goes we have been in the same circle for over a decade," she wrote. "A year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date. No moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter."
He's a hands-on father

The guitarist and
Something Borrowed
actress welcomed their daughter,
Rani Rose
, on Oct. 2, 2018. Hudson also shares Ryder with ex-husband
Chris Robinson
and son
Bingham Hawn Bellamy
with former partner
Matt Bellamy
. The
blended family
spends a lot of time together and is regularly featured on Hudson's Instagram account.

"My love, simply put, you are the most brilliant father ‚ù§Ô∏è We all love you so much," Hudson captioned a 2021 Father's Day
tribute to Fujikawa
.
In a December 2022 interview with
Byrdie
, Hudson shared that
she might have more children
with Fujikawa.
"I've been having children my entire adult life," she told the outlet. "I've got my 4-year-old and I've got a kid in college. And I don't even know if I'm done yet. You know, I don't have that answer yet."
Kate Hudson Instagram
In a June 2023 Instagram post, Hudson posted more photos of the proud dad with some of their kids, including a sweet snap of
Fujikawa holding Rani
when she was a baby. "I‚Äôm so grateful we shacked up together, had a baby and decided to be married," the actress wrote in the caption.
He is proud of his heritage
Stefanie Keenan/Gettyf
Fujikawa is Asian-American. His grandfather, Dr. Yoshihiko Fujikawa, was
one of the first
Japanese-Americans to attend medical school in the U.S. and was able to pay for school by working at a fruit stand. Fujikawa has posted about his Asian heritage on social media on numerous occasions.
In July 2017, Fujikawa shared
a photo
of a Blu-ray Disc box of Japanese cult hit
Akira
with the caption, "I'm a glass is half Japanese kind of guy." In 2012, he posted
an old photo
of his "ojisan and obachan," which means grandfather and grandmother in Japanese.

With Fujikawa's background in video editing and
music
, it made sense that he would handle the editing and music for one of Hudson's
Happy x Nature
clothing line promos. In March 2019, he shared an ad of Hudson modeling the clothes.
"Here lies the teaser I edited and musically composed for my baby's new 'ready-to-wear' clothing line,"
he wrote
. "Of all the clothes in the world that are ready to wear, these are the most ready."
Fujikawa also co-produced Hudson's debut album,
Glorious
, which was released in May 2024.
He popped the question to Hudson with a stunning ring

Hudson
announced her engagement
to Fujikawa on Sept. 13, 2021. The actress posted a photo of the pair kissing with her ring on full display and captioned it, "Let's go! üë∞‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüííü§µüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."

and
Her Abs at the 2021 Met Gala
That same day, Hudson debuted her stunning engagement ring again at the
2021 Met Gala
, although Fujikawa could not attend the event.
In December 2022, Hudson addressed why she and Fujikawa had yet to tie the knot.
"
I just haven't planned the wedding
," she told ITV's
This Morning
. "I go back and forth, I go, 'Do I really want a big wedding?' We're so happy. It's not the first thing I need."
She added: "I've been there before. I've got kids with three different dads. It's not really the golden ticket ‚Äî a wedding. And we also don't know where we're gonna do it. But it will happen."
He acts as a "teammate" to Hudson

Between acting, running a business,
hosting a podcast
and
raising three kids
, Hudson definitely has a full plate. Luckily, she receives plenty of support and help from Fujikawa, as she told
Women's Health
in 2019.
"If I have to go to a dinner meeting, he can be home," she said, adding that family is the "number one priority" for both of them.
"I've got the best man," she continued. "It's the first time I feel like I have a real teammate in this. We're able to pick up where the other one has to leave off."
In February 2025, Fujikawa accompanied Hudson to the Los Angeles premiere of her new Netflix series,
Running Point
.

While chatting with PEOPLE in May 2024, Hudson talked about the couple's
astrological compatibility
‚Äî and how it impacted their work on
Glorious
.
"I'm an Aries. I have butterfly feet. I am just like, ‚ÄòOK, I have to go to. I have to be somewhere else other than this room.‚Äô And Danny can sit in a room for 24 hours and not even know it's been 24 hours," she said of her Gemini partner.
Hudson continued, ‚ÄúSo I felt very lucky to be able to go make the kids dinner and then pop my head in and be like, ‚ÄòIs there anything I need to listen to yet?‚Äô It was great ‚Ä¶ When you can work really well together like that, it feels like magic when it's happening."
