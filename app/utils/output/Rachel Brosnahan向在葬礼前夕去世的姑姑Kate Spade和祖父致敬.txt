Brosnahan was among those to pay tribute to Spade's legacy,
becoming the face
of her accessories line Frances Valentine in January 2019. "In the wake of Katy's passing, my family and I were so overwhelmed and encouraged by the love and support we received from those who were touched by Katy's work, many of whom were strangers from around the world," she told PEOPLE at the time.
"When you lose someone you love, you search for boundless ways to keep their memory alive," Brosnahan explained. "This felt like a way to do that through her beautiful creations and an opportunity to share them with all of those who her work meant so much to."

In 2019, Brosnahan
told PEOPLE
that the first year since Spade's death was not an easy one.
"I think my family and I, as you can expect, are still grieving very deeply," Brosnahan told PEOPLE while speaking from the red carpet at the 2019
Tony Awards

On the one-year anniversary of Spade's death, the designer's original fashion brand, Kate Spade New York, announced it had completed its
$1 million pledge to support suicide prevention and mental health organizations.
"The Kate Spade New York Foundation announced it is donating $200,000 to The Jed Foundation (JED), which works to protect emotional health and prevent suicide in teens and young adults by partnering with schools and colleges to improve education and awareness programs," the brand said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.
The company also
honored the designer's legacy in 2020

24/7 access to crisis counseling and emotional support
as they worked the
frontlines

coronavirus pandemic
